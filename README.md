</p>

## TypeScript

Javascipt but with support for types, used to catch bugs in the fast paced development cycle to ensure consistency of data between components and server calls.
</p>

## Socket.IO
<p>
Wrapper over websockets(but still its own standard protocol) for better dev experience while handling bi directional communication between clients and server.
</p>

## ExpressJS and NodeJS
<p>
Server software(Express) and js runtime env(NodeJS) for writing backend
</p>
